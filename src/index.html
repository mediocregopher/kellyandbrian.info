      On Monday, February 22, 2021, Brian Picciano and Kelly Dutton, with just a
      photographer present to witness, self-solemnized their marriage in
      Evergreen, Colorado.

      After a short hike to the middle of a snowy aspen grove off Beaver Creek
      Trail, we said our self-written vows to each other, and finally became
      husband and wife.

    <p>
      The rest of the afternoon was spent traipsing around the forest, taking
      pictures in the snow, laughing, crying, freezing, and, above all, being
      endlessly grateful for each other.
