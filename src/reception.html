    <h1>Let's Celebrate!</h1>
    <p>
      We are planning on hosting a small, belated dinner reception in Florida in
      late 2021 for our families to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the exact date and location have yet to be decided, all details will
      be sent out as soon as we have them. We can't wait to celebrate with you!
